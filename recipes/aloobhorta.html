            Steps

        <ol>
            <li>Boil and peel potatoes. Mash them until lump-free, along with the salt and 3 g of the mustard oil. Slice the onions, garlic, and green chillies</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet or small frying pan, and add the remaining mustard oil (5 g) to it. Add the dried red chillies and roast them on medium heat until they have blackened. Remove from the heat and transfer them on to the dish containing the mashed potatoes.</li>
            <li>In the same pan, add the sliced onions. Fry them until they turn brown. This should take about 6 minutes. Next, add the sliced garlic and green chillies and fry them for another couple of minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Using your fingertips, rub in the fried dried-red chillies into a small amount of the potatoes. Once the chillies are mixed well, mash in the fried onion mixture too. Divide in four equal portions and enjoy with some steaming rice and dal.</li>
