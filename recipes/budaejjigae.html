        <p>Who said you couldn't eat swell in the trenches? A banger Korean dish robust with spiciness, savoriness, a slight sweet tone, and all the accoutrements you'd need. We can go on for days about the flavor, why don't we eat it instead?</p>

        <h2>
            Steps
        </h2>

        <p>
            Prepare stock:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine the water, anchovies, mushrooms, and kelp in a large pot. Cover and cook for 25 minutes over medium high heat. Add the pork and cook for another 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the pot from the heat. Take out the anchovies, kelp and mushrooms. Slice the mushrooms into bite size pieces.</li>
            <li>Strain the mixture of the stock and the pork into a large bowl. Put the pork into a small bowl. You will get about 6 cups of stock. Stir in the salt until dissolved.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Make seasoning paste
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine the seasoning paste ingredients - garlic, hot pepper paste, hot pepper flakes, soy sauce, sugar, and water in a bowl. Mix well.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Arrange the ingredients in a shallow pot (10 to 12 inch):
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Put the cabbage, onion, green onion, pork, and the mushrooms, on the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li>Add the kimchi, and the seasoning paste over top.</li>
            <li>Add the spam, sausage, rice cake, tofu, baked beans, and cheese.</li>
            <li>Add the ramyeon and the sweet potato starch noodles.</li>
            <li>Put radish sprouts on top and add 3 cups of stock.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Cook and Serve:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Cook over medium high heat. Korean style is to cook at the table with a portable burner. Friends and family will be sitting around the pot, talking and laughing, and maybe drinking. You can take a bit of cooked sausage or the meat with your chopsticks as you wait for the broth to boil and the noodles to soften. If you don’t have a tabletop burner, you can cook it on the stove away from the table.</li>
            <li>When it starts boiling about 10 minutes later, stir and turn the ingredients over with tongs to cook evenly.</li>
            <li>Serve right after the noodles and ramyeon have softened. Transfer some cooked stew to individual bowls and serve. Add more stock as the broth boils down.</li>
        </ol>
